# `1. NodeJs Setup`

I have setup this boilerplate code using Node Version: `16.13.0` (includes npm `8.1.0`)<br/>

### [üìù] Have NodeJs in your System

You can have the Node LTS and configure it from [Nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)<br/>

## `2. Setup The Project`

- You can clone this repo from command line using `git clone ${repo_url}`.

  - `git clone https://github.com/NainikCrest/Node_Boilerplate_Sequelize.git`

- Run `npm install | yarn`
- Create an `.env` file and add your configuration as per your need similar to reference file `.env.example`
- ## Seeding the data.
  - `sequelize db:seed:all` -> To get initial country listing
  - Dummy Email & Password registered :
    - Email: `whiteshark@crest.com` | Password: `111111`
- Run `npm start` -> to start the server.
